//Magic Dates 
//The date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is 
//written in the following format, the month times the 
//day equals the year: 6/10/60. Design a program that 
//asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), 
//a day, and a two-digit year. The program should then 
//determine whether the month times the day equals the year.
//If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic.
//Otherwise, it should display a message saying the date is not magic.
